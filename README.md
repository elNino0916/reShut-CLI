## reShut CLI is an easy-to-use tool that aims to streamline and improve the management of system reboots and shutdowns on your Windows computer.
> [!CAUTION]
> This is an early preview version of reShut CLI. Features and functionality may change before the final release. Use at your own risk, as this version may contain bugs or incomplete features.

> [!WARNING]
> This branch may not be updated regularly because I don't have much time and I test out changes locally first before pushing them eventually.
